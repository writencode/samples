## JGroups
Active/Inactive services based on JGroup API. We have a simple setup here where as views join the cluster, we nominate the 
first view in the list to be the active node for the cluster, while the rest of the nodes are inactive. 
One can run the program on different ports on the local machine

## Logging MDC
Adding correlation IDs to Web App + logging the logged in user if available by using MDC
